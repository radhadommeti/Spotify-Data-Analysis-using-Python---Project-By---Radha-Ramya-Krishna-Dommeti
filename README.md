INTRODUCTION


Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006. It is the world's largest music streaming service provider and has over 381 million monthly active users, which also includes 172 million paid subscribers.

Here, We'll exploring and quantify data about music and drawing valuable insights.

Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization project using data from Spotify using Python.

Data analysis exploring the relationship between the audio features of a song and how positive or negative its lyrics are, involving sentiment analysis.

Includes data collection script that scrapes audio feature data from the Spotify API, as well as lyrical data from the LyricWikiAPI

Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify. Learners will use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support learners in developing their ability to review and interpret a dataset. The activity starts by encouraging learners to think of questions that the dataset might answer and thus develop their “Problem” skills. Once the dataset has been analysed learners will have the opportunity to reorganise and restructure data to help them answer their questions
